                    This whole website as a whole exists as somewhat of a bio. However I will try not to share too much
                    about myself because it probably is not a good idea so publically online. These are the things I
                    have no shame in sharing:
                </div>
            </Col>
        </Row>
    </div>
)

export default Purpose;
